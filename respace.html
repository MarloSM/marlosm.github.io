				<p>Respace Project is our attempt at forming a space-efficient standard for all future furniture. Its primarily tackling the issue of the increasing population in relation to the limited amount of land we have to accommodate the growth.</p>

				<div id="motive"><h3>What was the Motive?</h3></div>
				<p>With the world supporting over 7.4 billion people and expected to grow to 10 billion by 2056, we’re quickly running out of space to live in. It doesn’t help that the average house size around the world is increasing with the addition of a home office and an extra bedroom becoming more common. We made the Respace Project so that everyone can have their fare share of space.<br><br>

					We’re doing it so that we can use less space without feeling deprived or hindered by the lack of it.	We want a situation where a home office and a bedroom had to be in two rooms can now be in one. Where a house used to only fit three rooms but can now fit four. Where a plot of land used to have one house but can now have two. Where the world used to house 7.4 billion people but can soon fit 10 billion.</p>

					<div id="outcome"><h3>What is Respace?</h3></div>
					<p>While the main artefact for Respace Project is a scaled prototype for future furniture, the more significant outcome is a better understanding of the problem and standards that should be discussed. With an increasing issue with the amount of space our homes are taking up, many have tried to come up with a solution. All working within their own system of products. Many have also made drastic changes to how we use and see furniture which makes the transition from conventional furniture to space saving furniture that much more difficult.<br><br>

						Respace is not only a design towards space-efficient furniture, it’s also a design to make the cultrural transition easier. By making most of the design as similar to what they normally are, it creates a sense of familiarity which makes the products more approachable. The biggest alteration is providing the users the ability to use them efficiently. Through the project, we came across aspects of modular furniture design that we think should be discussed to be widely acceptable rules and regulations for creating and designing all types of furniture.<br><br>

						- All furniture must have a unified connection system to ensure that they are compatible with all othe product lines.<br><br>

						- Storage furniture (e.g. shelves, drawers, wardrobe) must ensure that they can support other storage furniture above them or can be supported by other storage spaces from underneath by utilising the unified connection system.<br><br>

						- All furniture that are occasionally used (e.g. table, bed) must have a mechanism where it can transform to a more compact form while it’s is unused. This compact form must utilise vertical space, resulting in more floor space while it is compacted.</p>
